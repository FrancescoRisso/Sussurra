	"At the start of the game each player is given 4 cards. The goal of the game is to finish the match with the lowest score possible. Scoring follows this rules:",
	"The 4 cards are arranged in a rectangular shape, as in the image, but the player can only look at the lower ones (the red ones). The cards on top stay covered, so the player does not know what they are. In addition, when the game starts, each player does not know any of the opponents' cards.",
	"At this point the real game begins: taking turns, every player draws a card from the central deck, and thy can either discard it, or switch it with one of their cards, even if that one is unknown. The replaced card must be discarded, and is visible to all players. The freshly-drawn card, on the other hand, is visible only to the player that drew it.",
	"When a card is discarded, every player who has another card with the same number is allowed to throw it, remaining with one less card. However, you must be fast, because the the turn passes to the next player, and if he discards a different card, you cannot throw yours anymore.",
	'In every moment during their turn, a player cand say "stop": at that point the game continues until it\'s the player\'s turn again (but the player does not play anymore), then all the cards are revealed, and the winner is the player with the lowest score, computed as the sum of every (revealed and not revealed) card of each player. The game also ends if a player runs out of cards: as before, the game continues until it\'s the player without cards\' turn, with this player not playing anymore.',

	"give a look at one of the opponents' cards, then decide if they wish to switch it with one of their cards.",
	'In every case the player can only know the value of the cards they have "already seen": for example, in case of a switch with a discarded J, if the player takes from an opponent a card the player itself has not seen yet, they will not be able to look at it, other than discarding an 8 from the deck (or switching it with a deck card, thus discarding it).',

	"Example: let's imagine that the player knows two of his cards, a 4 and a 7. The player draws from the deck a very high card, such as a Q. At this point, it is not convenient to replace a known card (a 4 or a 7) with the new one, because the total value of his cards would increase (please remember, the goal of the game is to minimize the total score). On the other side, it is not even convenient to replace one of the unknown cards, since the probability that these cards have a lower value than the drawn one is very high. Thus, in this case it is convenient to discard the drawn card.",
	'Example: let\'s imagine that a player has just two cards left, an A and a 3, while all the other players have at least 3 cards. At this point, it is very likely that he is in the lead, so it is convenient for him to say "STOP". Beware though: the game does not end when someone says "STOP", so the situation can still change. For instance, another player could switch some cards (see below), thus completely reversing the situation.',
	"At the end of the game, when the results are shown, in the bottom left corner you can find a button to hide the results, to see revealed all the cards from every player."
